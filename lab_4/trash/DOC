Trash program moves files temporary to trash bin.

Implementation notes:

Actual bin is created at $HOME/.trash of form
.trash/
 - links/*
 - lock
 - log
 - last

Links catalog is used for storing hard links.

File named "lock" must be used via flock whenever any trash modification is needed.
File named "log" is of form "id path name", where:
 - id is a hexadecimal number representing link in links/
 - path is base64 encoded path of the original file
 - name is base64 encoded name of the original file
